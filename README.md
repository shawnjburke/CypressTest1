# Notes

All of the code, including modules, were stored in the repository.  It is not normal to store things like modules.  I stored them 
as a point in time to match the video as an archive.

Visual Studio Code was choosen as our IDE because it's free, available across platforms, and generally widely supported at the time of writing.
